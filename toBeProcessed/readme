newest version (20/4)
to be fixed:
rerun fixer to get better page numbering
            and to remove " in titles
some files (Petri and LegBil/Bu) have different page numbering..:(
all files don't have page numbers
lydekin has a 'm-runa' (&#xF*FF)


to korp:
cannot use '.' (word.pagenum)
add labels
